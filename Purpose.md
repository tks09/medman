# Medicine Manager

## Purpose

This project is supposed to provide a web interface where you can login as a user. Once you are logged in, you can use generative Ai (Mistral via API key) to generate a medication review plan. The user will write something like:

> I'm planning to take Ritalin. Please generate a list of all side effects, especially effects that are related to digestive functions

Then, the software should generate a daily review formular, that can be used by the user to track their medication effects and side effects.

## Technology

In the backend, use MongoDB as a storage and Rust as a backend language. Please use tokio and axum as frameworks. For the frontend, generate a frontend based on vue.js and tailwind css. please use up to date technologies.
